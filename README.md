# Notes App

---

Full-stack web app developed using React and TypeScript for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js as the backend framework. The application utilizes a MongoDB database hosted on Atlas.

The app provides users with the ability to create, edit, and delete notes, but requires authentication to access these features. Users are required to log in before they can start managing their notes.

The frontend is built with React and TypeScript. The backend utilizes Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and interact with the MongoDB database.
